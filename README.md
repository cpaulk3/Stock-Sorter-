# Stock-Sorter-
Stock-sorter.py will be a program that is set to find and sort different metrics of the chosen companies that will be used to compare slected companies against each other. When it is done the program will be used to shorten the time the user has to spend on finding companies with disarable metrics and let them spend more time on the valuation of those companies
